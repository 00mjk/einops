# einops

A new flavour of deep learning ops for pytorch, chainer, gluon, tensorflow and others.

## About

`einops` introduces a new way to manipulate tensors. 

## Examples

```python
from einops import rearrange, reduce




```


## Layers


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install einops
```

The only dependency `einops` has is `numpy`,  

## Working with ...

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [tensorflow eager](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager)
- [cupy](https://cupy.chainer.org/)
- [chainer](https://chainer.org/)
- [gluon](https://mxnet.apache.org/)
- [mxnet](https://gluon.mxnet.io/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- and [keras](https://keras.io/) (experimental)

## Contributing 

Best ways to contribute are

- spread the word about `einops`
- prepare a guide/post specifically for your favorite deep learning framework
- if you have an interesting use case, not yet covered by documentation, let me know


## Supported python versions

`einops` works with python 3.5 or later. 

There is nothing specific to python 3 in the code, just we need to move further.
